# What Is GitHub, and What Is It Used For?

 Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub — ___GitHub.com___ — where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.

 It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.
